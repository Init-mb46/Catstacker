# Catstacker
CSA final project 2022
A simple game run on the libGDX framework

# Disclaimer
This might be a little tricky to run on mac, as this was developed on a desktop, and run with desktop run configurations only.

# How to Run
Clone the repository into a folder, then open within android studio, intellij or eclipse, and set the proper run configuration then run. Again, might not work properly on Mac.
