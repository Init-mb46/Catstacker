# Catstacker
CSA final project 2022
A simple game run on the libGDX framework

# Disclaimer
This might be a little tricky to run on mac, as this was developed on a desktop, and run with desktop run configurations only.
Replit WILL NOT WORK, as there is no Gradle support on Replit.

# How to Run
Clone the repository into a folder, then open within android studio, intellij or eclipse, and set the proper run configuration then run. Again, might not work properly on Mac.
1. Clone the repository using git or download all the code as a zip file
2. Open up the main project folder in one of the ides mentioned above
3. Allow all dependencies to load
4. Navigate to the main desktop class, and right click, then press run
5. The program should work!
